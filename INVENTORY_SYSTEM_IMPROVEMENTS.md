# Inventory System Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Kuralis inventory management system to address race conditions, ensure data consistency, and provide robust cross-platform synchronization.

## 🔧 **Key Improvements Made**

### 1. **Distributed Locking with Redis**
- **Added**: `redis-lock` gem for distributed locking
- **Purpose**: Prevents race conditions when multiple processes try to modify inventory simultaneously
- **Implementation**: All inventory operations now use Redis-based distributed locks with configurable timeouts

### 2. **Enhanced InventoryService**
- **Atomic Operations**: All inventory changes now happen within database transactions
- **Idempotency Protection**: Duplicate operations are automatically detected and prevented
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging and notifications
- **Lock Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts prevent deadlocks

### 3. **Cross-Platform Inventory Synchronization**
- **New Job**: `CrossPlatformInventorySyncJob` handles syncing inventory across Shopify and eBay
- **Skip Platform Logic**: Prevents infinite loops by skipping the originating platform
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed sync attempts
- **Internal Record Updates**: Updates internal platform records regardless of API success

### 4. **Inventory Reconciliation Service**
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies discrepancies between platforms
- **Auto-Correction**: Attempts to automatically fix platform discrepancies
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Only notifies for significant discrepancies
- **Transaction-Based Reconciliation**: Reconciles internal inventory based on transaction history

### 5. **Enhanced Order Processing**
- **Idempotency Protection**: Prevents duplicate order processing
- **Unified Service**: Single service handles both eBay and Shopify orders
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and notifications
- **Inventory Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the new inventory system

### 6. **Product Status Management**
- **Coordinated Updates**: Status changes are synchronized across all platforms
- **Valid Transitions**: Enforces valid status transition rules
- **Platform Integration**: Automatically handles platform-specific status updates
- **Audit Trail**: All status changes are logged with reasons

### 7. **Monitoring and Health Checks**
- **Automated Monitoring**: Regular health checks detect issues proactively
- **Multiple Alert Levels**: Critical, warning, and info alerts
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks inventory, transactions, and platform discrepancies
- **Dashboard Integration**: Health metrics cached for dashboard display

## 🚀 **New Services and Jobs**

### Services
- `InventoryService` - Enhanced with distributed locking and idempotency
- `CrossPlatformInventorySyncJob` - Handles cross-platform inventory sync
- `InventoryReconciliationService` - Detects and corrects discrepancies
- `OrderProcessingService` - Unified order processing with idempotency
- `ProductStatusService` - Coordinated product status management
- `InventoryMonitoringService` - Health checks and metrics

### Jobs
- `CrossPlatformInventorySyncJob` - Syncs inventory across platforms
- `InventoryHealthCheckJob` - Scheduled health monitoring (every 15 minutes)

## 🔄 **Order Flow Improvements**

### eBay Order Flow
1. Order imported via `Ebay::SyncOrdersJob`
2. Processed through `OrderProcessingService` with idempotency
3. Inventory allocated via enhanced `InventoryService`
4. Cross-platform sync triggered (skipping eBay)
5. Internal records updated on all platforms

### Shopify Order Flow
1. Order imported via `Shopify::SyncOrdersJob`
2. Processed through `OrderProcessingService` with idempotency
3. Inventory allocated via enhanced `InventoryService`
4. Cross-platform sync triggered (skipping Shopify)
5. Internal records updated on all platforms

## 🛡️ **Race Condition Prevention**

### Before
- Multiple processes could modify inventory simultaneously
- Database-level locking only (insufficient for distributed systems)
- No idempotency protection
- Potential for inventory discrepancies

### After
- Redis distributed locking prevents concurrent modifications
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing
- Atomic database transactions ensure consistency
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## 📊 **Monitoring and Alerting**

### Health Check Categories
- **Critical Low Inventory**: Products with ≤5 units
- **Warning Low Inventory**: Products with ≤10 units
- **Failed Allocations**: High failure rate detection
- **Platform Discrepancies**: Inventory mismatches between platforms
- **Stale Data**: Products not updated in >4 hours
- **Stuck Transactions**: Unprocessed transactions >30 minutes

### Alert Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required
- **Error**: System issues that need resolution
- **Warning**: Potential issues to monitor
- **Info**: General status information

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### Redis Lock Settings
```ruby
LOCK_TIMEOUT = 30          # Max wait time for lock acquisition
REDIS_LOCK_TIMEOUT = 60    # Max time to hold a lock
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
```ruby
CRITICAL_LOW_INVENTORY_THRESHOLD = 5
WARNING_LOW_INVENTORY_THRESHOLD = 10
FAILED_ALLOCATION_THRESHOLD = 5  # per hour
DISCREPANCY_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD = 10.0
```

### Scheduled Jobs
- **Inventory Health Check**: Every 15 minutes
- **Order Sync**: Configurable per platform
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Triggered by inventory changes

## 🚨 **Error Handling**

### Inventory Operations
- Lock timeout errors with proper logging
- Insufficient inventory notifications
- Failed sync attempt tracking
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Order Processing
- Duplicate order detection
- Invalid product handling
- Inventory allocation failures
- Comprehensive error notifications

## 📈 **Performance Improvements**

### Reduced Database Contention
- Distributed locking reduces database lock contention
- Atomic transactions minimize lock duration
- Async processing for non-critical operations

### Improved Reliability
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Retry logic handles temporary failures
- Health monitoring detects issues early

### Better Scalability
- Redis-based locking scales across multiple servers
- Queue-based processing handles load spikes
- Cached health metrics reduce database queries

## 🔍 **Debugging and Troubleshooting**

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging for all inventory operations
- Lock acquisition and release tracking
- Error details with stack traces
- Performance metrics logging

### Monitoring
- Real-time health status in cache
- Historical transaction tracking
- Platform sync success/failure rates
- Alert history and resolution tracking

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy changes and monitor health metrics
2. **Fine-tune Thresholds**: Adjust alert thresholds based on actual usage
3. **Add More Metrics**: Expand monitoring to cover additional scenarios
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize based on production performance data
5. **Documentation**: Create user-facing documentation for new features

## 🔗 **Dependencies**

### New Gems Added
- `redis-lock (~> 0.2.0)` - Distributed locking

### Existing Dependencies Used
- `redis` - Redis client
- `sidekiq` - Background job processing
- `sidekiq-scheduler` - Scheduled job management
